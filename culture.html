    <span class="w3-tag w3-red"> Dashain </span> is the longest and the most auspicious festival in the Bikram Sambat annual calendar, celebrated by Nepalese people, Lhotshampa, Burmese Gurkhas and Indian Gorkhas, along with their diaspora throughout the globe. It is the longest and most anticipated festival in Nepal, Bhutan, Burma and North Indian hills. </li>
      <li>
   <span class="w3-tag w3-indigo"> Bhai-Tika </span> is an extremely important festival for brothers and sisters all over Nepal and they celebrate the occasion with lot of enthusiasm and gaiety. On this day, sisters apply tilak on the forehead of their brothers and pray to Lord Yama, the God of death, for their brother’s long and prosperous life. Exchange of gifts besides lot of merriment marks the beautiful festival of Bhai Teeka.  There is a popular legend behind the origination of Bhai Tika in Nepal. It says that long ago a sister saved the life of his brother from the clutches of Yamaraj (the God of death) by performing Bhai Tika. Since that time sisters have been applying tikka on their brothers forehead, in a belief that this will protect their brothers from death and they will enjoy a long life. Sisters also pray for their brothers health and prosperity on this day.
     </li>
      <li>
   <span class="w3-tag w3-khaki"> Tihar </span>, also known as Deepawali and Yamapanchak, is a five-day-long Hindu festival celebrated in Nepal and in the Indian states of Assam and Sikkim including in Darjeeling district of West Bengal. It is the festival of lights, as diyas are lit inside and outside the houses to make it illuminate at night. It is popularly known as Swanti among the Newars and as Deepawali among Madhesis. Set in the Vikram Samvat calendar, the festival begins with Kaag Tihar in Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha and ends with Bhai Tika in Dwitiya of Kartik Sukla Paksha every year. </li>
      <li>
   <span class="w3-tag w3-green"> Teej </span> has mainly two-fold: First, as a festival for women, Teej celebrates the victory of a wife's love and devotion towards her husband--an important tradition in Hinduism--symbolized by the union of Shiva and Parvati.Second, Teej ushers in the advent of the monsoons--the season of rains that brings a reason to celebrate as  people can take a break from the sweltering heat and enjoy the swing of the monsoon--"Sawan ke jhooley." In addition, it's an occasion for married women to visit their parents and return with gifts for their in-laws and spouse.

Teej, therefore, provides an opportunity to renew family bonds. </li>

      <td>  This festival of water and colors that falls between February/March is also known as “Phagu” in Nepal. This day is observed to rejoice the extermination of female demon Holika who together with her King brother conspired to kill his son Pralhad, an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu.

      <td> Shivaratri (Maha Shivaratri): </td>
      <td>  Shivaratri or the night of Lord Shiva that falls sometime between February/March is one of the major festivals of Nepal. This day is dedicated to the Lord of the Lords – Lord Shiva or Mahadev who lived in Mt. Kailash in the Himalayas. Lord Shiva is the most worshipped God in the Hindu religion. More than 100,000 of Hindu devotees from India and Southeast Asia throng weeks ahead of the festival and gather in and around Pashupatinath temple – one of the holiest shrines of the Hindus in Kathmandu to pay their homage to Lord Shiva on his birthday. “Pashupatinath” literally means “the Lord of animals” as Lord Shiva is considered as the guardian and protector of everything that exists in the Himalayan Kingdom. On this holy day, worshippers take dip and bath in the holy river at early dawn and fast for the whole day and stay around fire to keep them warm as it is still winter in Nepal. The devotees also freely indulge in using marijuana and other intoxicating substances as these things are believed to please Lord Shiva and marijuana use is legal only on this sacred day. </td>

      <td> Buddha Jayanti: </td>
      <td> Buddha’s birth anniversary is celebrated every year during May in Nepal. On this day people swarm in Swayambhunath and Boudhanath to pay homage to Lord Buddha and also visit Buddha’s birth place in Lumbini and chant prayers and burn butter lamps. Lord Buddha was born as Prince Siddhartha Gautam but he abandoned his luxurious life when he realized the misery of mankind and went in search of englightment.  </td>

    <tr>
      <td> Tihar:  </td>
      <td>  This festival of lights that falls between October/November is the second biggest festival after Dashain. This festival lasts for five days and people worship Laxmi – the Goddess of Wealth. All the houses are cleaned and decorated with the belief that Goddess Laxmi will enter the house that is the cleanest and people lit candles, oil lamps and other lights and the whole place looks illuminating. During the five days, crows, dogs and cows are worshipped and honored with vermilion, garland and delicious food for what they have done in the lives of humans. Crows are regarded as the messenger that brought news even during the times when there were no postmen and no postal services. Dogs are the most obedient animals and they guard our house as true guardians. Cow is also a symbol of wealth in Hinduism and she is also the national animal of Nepal. During Tihar, the Newari community in Nepal also observes Mha puja – a ritual of worshipping one’s own body and life. On this very day, the Newari New Year which is also known as Nepal Sambat begins. The festival ends with Bhai Tika – brothers’ day when his sisters worship him for his long and healthy life to safeguard the lives of his sisters. This is also a gambling time in Nepal as gambling is not illegal during this festival.   </td>
