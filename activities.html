   The <span class="w3-tag w3-red">The Thrill of Bungy Jumping in Nepal </span> Bungy jumping is taking the world by storm, particularly after having recently found additional venues within the highest mountain peaks in the world - the Himalaya mountain range. It’s a crazy sport that has some of the best views imaginable, if you don’t mind heights and being upside down. It has to be said that the Nepal bungy jump experience, with the longest free-fall to date, is nothing like you could imagine at 160 meters over the untamed waters of the Bhote Koshi. It is about a three hour drive from Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, to begin your adrenalin pumping adventure. At the moment there is only one bungy jumping agency operating in Nepal, known as ‘The Last Resort’. This agency hosts some of the most experienced jumpmasters in the field of bungy jumping. The jump they offer was designed by one of the leading consultants in New Zealand and abides by the strict international standards, thus guaranteeing the utmost safety from beginning to end. The bungy jump in Nepal takes place from a 166 meter steel suspension bridge that is Swiss designed and made specifically for bungy jumping, with a safety factor of x4 and a loading factor of 4.5t or 41,500kg. Interestingly, before the bridge was constructed, surrounding villagers would have to walk for about 5 hours in order to cross the river gorge safely. </li>

   <span class="w3-tag w3-khaki"> Spectacular Hot Air Ballooning in Nepal </span>  There are many ways to see the beautifully diverse Nepal, but nothing quite compares with a hot air balloon ride - it’ll be an hour that you will never forget. One such example is the hot air balloon sunrise ride. It is truly breathtaking as you gaze 360 degrees around upon the most magical scenery. It all begins as you gently rise over historical temples, roofed houses tiled in red, lonely stupas and fields painted in colors from nature's palette. Then suddenly your eye catches sight of the majestic range of the Himalayan mountains, capturing some of the most rugged beauties such as Langtang Himal and the greatest of them all Mount Everest, snow capped and bathing in the gentle rays of the early morning sun. During your gentle ascent you will float to about 1200 to 1500 meters, which will bring you close to the 3,000 meter mark made by many adventurous mountaineers. Perched in an enchanting wicker basket you will leisurely move above the well-known Kathmandu Valley rolling beneath you. An interesting fact about hot air ballooning is that it is one of the oldest methods of air travel in the world and considered the safest of them all to date. </li>
